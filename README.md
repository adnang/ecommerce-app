# Shopping Cart App

Given extra time, I would
- map request DTOs to the commands
- introduce a command executor layer between the controllers and the domain, with the Mediatr library as a possible implementation
- implement logging
- return real error responses
- use Swagger Code gen to generate a client library instead of bespoke
- add swagger documentation
